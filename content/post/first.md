# Nitros

Quick and easy performance analyzer library for [Go](http://golang.org/).

## Overview

Nitro is a quick and easy performance analyzer library for Go.
It is useful for comparing A/B against different drafts of functions
or different functions.

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

Using Nitro is simple. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

    $ go get github.com/spf13/nitro

Next, include nitro in your application.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
